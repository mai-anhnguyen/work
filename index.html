        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This study explores the accessibility and usability of dropdown menus
          across various applications. I examine the input methods, output
          responses, and overall user experience for both mouse and keyboard
          users. By analyzing and revising state models, I propose a possible
          redesign.

        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>
          Dropdown menu components are implemented in TextEdit (a simple macOS
          text editor), GitHub Desktop, and Target.com. Below are slideshows
          showing how dropdown menus appear in various applications in various
          states.

          Dropdown menus in the different applications output feedback to the

          is a color change associated with a change in hover or focus.

        <h2>State Models</h2>
        <p>
          The state models visualize how a user may interact with the dropdown
          component as it currently exists on the application or website. The
          state models represent both mouse users and keyboard users. The models
          illustrate the varying states of the dropdown component, including
          default, focused, hovered, and active.

          The following two state models revise the dropdown component such that
          when the user hovers or focuses on the component, the dropdown
          automatically expands.

        <h2>Component Redesign</h2>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px">
          The dropdown component has been revised with the mouse user in mind.
          The revised state model reflects how the dropdown will activate when
          the user’s mouse hovers over the dropdown label. Previously, the user
          had to click the label to expand the dropdown. This increases
          efficiency for the mouse user. There is a new risk of decreased
          efficiency if the user is not used to the hover function and
          accidentally opens the dropdowns. The revised dropdown can increase
          learnability for both mouse and keyboard users since they can see the
          available options without additional clicks or presses.

          However, the trade off is that for keyboard users, this change could
          make navigating the page less efficient. If the dropdown opens
          automatically on hover, with keyboard navigation, the keyboard user
          may have to press Tab through all the options in the dropdown menu in
          order to get to a different component on the page. If the user hovers
          over a specific option on the dropdown, there will be a visual output
          of bold text. This indicates which option the user is hovering over or
          selecting.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In conclusion, dropdowns that did well in usability and accessibility
          were compatible with keyboard navigation. Users can navigate the list
          of options of the dropdown using the Tab or Shift + Tab key.
          Additionally, feedback was visually given to the user. When the mouse
          user hovers or the keyboard user focuses on the dropdown it changes
          color. To open the dropdown, the user must click the dropdown label.
          The component aligns with users’ mental model of a dropdown, as the
          selection list dropped vertically from the dropdown label. I applied
          these principles in my design by outputting feedback with visual
          changes. For instance, when hovering over an option in the list, the
          text turns to bold face. In my component design, I accounted for the
          learnability of users. Now, when the mouse user hovers over the
          dropdown, it expands automatically without needing an extra click. For
          the keyboard user, when the Tab key is pressed to reach the dropdown
          component, it expands automatically. Similar to the examples in the
          video, addressing a mismatch ends up being helpful for all users in
          general. The design’s original purpose is to help with learnability,
          but ends up potentially increasing the efficiency of navigating the
          page for all users.

          TextEdit on macOS had keyboard navigation that was extremely limited.
          Tab and Shift + Tab keys did not affect the selection of any
          components. The dropdowns could not be accessed solely with keyboard
          navigation. This negatively impacts users with motor impairments and
          rely on functionality through the keyboard solely. The screen reader
          provided ample output to the user on Target.com. It would recite the
          text label of the dropdown and also specify to the user if the
          dropdown is collapsed. This positively impacts users with visual
          impairments who are blind or have low vision and rely on screen
          readers. In the process of creating components, I think that mouse
          users are most commonly prioritized. This could potentially mean that
          the interface is not as clear for mobile/touch users if the design is
          not responsive. Also, as the TextEdit example shows, keyboard users
          could be negatively impacted if the product is not built with them in
          mind and only works effectively with a mouse.
